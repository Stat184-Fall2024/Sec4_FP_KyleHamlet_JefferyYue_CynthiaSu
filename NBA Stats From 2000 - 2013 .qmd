## Research Question 1: Is a playerâ€™s 3-point shooting percentage related to free throw shooting percentage?

## Load Package

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

```

## Data Loading & Preprocessing

```{r}
player_data <- read.csv("NBA Players 1999-2023 - Sheet1.csv")

player_data
```

```{r}

cleaned_data <- player_data %>%
  select(`Player`,`X3P.`, `FT.`) %>%
  rename(player_name = `Player`,three_point_pct = `X3P.`, free_throw_pct = `FT.`) %>%
  drop_na()

cleaned_data
```

## Data Exploration

```{r}
ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = free_throw_pct, y = three_point_pct)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Scatter Plot of 3-Point Percentage vs Free Throw Percentage",
    x = "Free Throw Percentage",
    y = "3-Point Percentage"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Correlation Test

```{r}
correlation <- cor.test(cleaned_data$three_point_pct, cleaned_data$free_throw_pct, method = "pearson")

correlation

```

```{r}
if (correlation$p.value < 0.05) {
  cat("Found significant correlation between 3-point shooting percentage and free throw shooting percentage (r =", round(correlation$estimate, 2), ").")
} else {
  cat("Found no significant correlation between 3-point shooting percentage and free throw shooting percentage.")
}

```
